It has crippled the country’s economy for a long time to come. In this book, Arun Kumar, the country’s leading authority on the black economy, tells us why Modi’s gambit failed. He shows us the way in which the problem can be rooted out, provided the government has the political will and determination to act.<br><br>Today, the black economy is estimated to be 62 per cent of GDP—or about `93 lakh crore ($1.4 trillion). Corrupt businessmen, corrupt politicians, and corrupt members of the executive (bureaucrats, police and the judiciary) are responsible for controlling the black economy and enabling its growth. If the black economy were to be dismantled and turned into a part of the ‘white’ economy, the country’s rate of growth would be 12 per cent. If it had not grown the way it has since the 1970s, India’s per capita income today would be approximately `7 lakh per annum ($11,000) and India would become the second largest economy in the world. If the black economy were taxed at current rates, it would generate `37 lakh crore in additional taxes and the union budget would show a surplus of `31 lakh crore instead of a deficit.<br><br>The failure of successive governments to tackle the problem effectively has been the single biggest obstacle to eradicating poverty. It is the cause of both widespread policy failure and the inability of the nation to improve its living conditions rapidly.</span>  </div>",Politics & Government eBooks,, 305.90 ,,4 February 2017,Aleph Book Company,151 ratings,https://www.amazon.in/Understanding-Black-Economy-Money-India-ebook/product-reviews/B01N26PJOI/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,"  Understanding the Black Economy and Black Money in India: An Enquiry into Causes, Consequences & Remedies "

He has been called one of the century’s foremost explorers of the universe by the New York Times obituary. His ground breaking discoveries indicated to us that there is much more out there in our solar system than we knew about. <br><br>Jan described dark matter to be the cause of the gravitational pull which pulls and keeps all the galaxies together. It was also thought that this gravity would slow the expansion of the universe as time went on. In 1998 however the Hubble Space Telescope made another discovery about the expansion of the universe. It had not been slowed down despite the presence of gravity. The expansion was occurring even faster than what it had been before. <br><br>Some mysterious thing was responsible for this expansion. It was given the name of </span><span class=""a-text-bold"">dark energy</span><span>. Dark energy can be described to be the property of space. Einstein discovered that it is possible for more space to come into being. <br><br>Planck which is a more sensitive satellite orbiting in the sky has made a thrilling new discovery lately. It was launched in 2009. It has managed to map the cosmic microwave background allowing scientists to look at remnants of light about 370,000 years after the occurrence of the big bang. Light has been thought to be trapped in some hot plasma which cooled. This caused the light to be set free from it. <br><br>There are tiny imprints representing quantum fluctuations which occurred after the birth of the universe. It is this substance from which the all the matter which formed the stars and the galaxies came from. <br><br>Planck is a more sensitive satellite with a higher resolution capability. Light patterns even one twelfth of a degree can be measured on the sky. <br><br>The version of Einstein theory containing the cosmological constant states that empty space has its own energy. This energy will not be diluted even as the space expands. This property of space can cause the expansion of the universe to become faster. <br><br>Space is also thought to get its energy from virtual particles which would appear and disappear. The calculation of energy however was not possible to calculate with enough accuracy. <br><br></span><span class=""a-text-bold"">Would You Like To Know More?</span><span><br><br></span><span class=""a-text-bold"">Buy Now for the Price of a Coffee!</span>  </div>","Sciences, Technology & Medicine",, 217.12 ,22 pages,7 October 2014,,70 ratings,https://www.amazon.in/DARK-ENERGY-Universe-universe-holographic-ebook/product-reviews/B00O9ZF4GW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,"  DARK ENERGY: The Biggest Mystery In The Universe (dark matter, how the universe works, holographic universe, quantum physics) (black holes, parallel universe, the string theory) "

But according to the type which prevails, we name the divisions. It is not that you can find men who have no other faculty than that of work, nor that you can find men who are no more than devoted worshippers only, nor that there are men who have no more than mere knowledge. These divisions are made in accordance with the type or the tendency that may be seen to prevail in a man. We have found that, in the end, all these four paths converge and become one.

Indian government constituted various committees to understand the nature and magnitude of black economy and suggest remedial measures. However, black money proportion of GDP has increased consistently which proves that there is too much theory and too little practice when it comes to tackling this issue. Issues of black money, tax evasion, money-laundering, benami property, terror financing etc. are highly interrelated because the prime motive of the perpetrators of crime is to get unlawful financial gains. Globalised world has provided multiple ways to the perpetrators of the financial crimes to hide their identity. Lack of cooperation between the countries is one of the primary reasons which prevents the meaningful resolution of cases. Role of political machinery is also quite important because political establishment drives the legislative and policy decisions.<br>In November 2016, India demonetised high value currency notes with an aim to reduce the cash circulating in the economy with an understanding that a significant part of black money is in the form of cash. This book aims to cover the issue of black money, its causes &amp; consequences and the way out.

People of modern societies would rather take a pill or find some quick way to make them feel better. The truth is that anyone can make themselves feel better with the use of an ancient meditation called the “mantra”. Mantras have unique spiritual powers that can help a person clear their minds of all mental thoughts while bringing them closer to the spiritual world where they can be at peace. Many ancient religions have used this technique in the past to meditate and be closer to the spirits of the world. Have you ever heard of Hinduism or Buddhism? These ancient religions of India were the very first two religions to use mantras and incorporate them into a meditation practice. For over 3000 years, mantras have continued to be used in these religions and have also been derived into many other religions that came afterwards. <br><br>This book is not meant to convert you into a Hindu or Buddhist. Frankly, that would have to be a personal choice and no one can convince you to do that. But what this book does is explain in great detail about mantras, including how they are used and the great spiritual power that exists behind them. Believe it or not, you don’t have to be associated with any particular religion in order to perform mantras and receive the power that they give to you. All you have to know is what mantras are and how to actually perform them in your daily ritual. Most of the time, mantras will be conducted through your meditation practices. Mantras and meditation are almost synonymous because they both get you to a spiritual place where all your mortal thoughts and feeling cease to exist. By even if you want to perform everyday activities, like driving a car or walking down the street, you can still use mantras as a way to relax and clear your mind during these situations as well. That is the great joy about performing mantras because you can literally perform them anywhere while conducting any nonverbal activity. You will learn the specifics of how this can be done and how it can change your everyday life for the better. After all, can’t we all use a simple non-medical way to alleviate our stress and anxiety? <br><br>What’s covered in this book:<br><br>What are mantras<br>How to say the mantras<br>The Om (Aum)<br>Power of Mantras<br>How to chant mantras<br>Benefits of Meditation<br>Ganesha Mantra<br>Gayatri Mantra<br>Mahamrityunjay mantra<br>Hanuman Mantra<br>Mahakali mantra<br>Hare Krishna Mantra<br>Mahalakshmi Mantra<br>Shree Ram Mantra<br>Shiva Mantra<br>Shanti Mantra<br>Durga Mantra<br>Thank you</span>  </div>",Religion & Spirituality,, 78.00 ,39 pages,25 September 2015,,69 ratings,https://www.amazon.in/Mantra-Healing-Mantras-Health-Success-ebook/product-reviews/B015UDS512/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,"  Mantra Healing: Mantras for Long Life, Health, Wealth, Success and Inner Peace "
